# Automated-Attendance-System-using-CNN

An end-to-end face identification and attendance approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which processes the CCTV footage or a video of the class and mark the attendance of the entire class in a single shot. One of the main advantages of the proposed solution is its robustness against usual challenges like occlusion (partially visible/covered faces), orientation, alignment and luminescence of the classroom.
